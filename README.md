I have failed to find an adequate representation on the internet on how to use the cuda cudnn library therefore this rope will aim at trying to rectify the situation. I will post code and anybody that has been having the same frustrations as I please feel free to post some code that can help others learn this amazing library

if anybody reading this repo or finds value in it or thinks i screwed up somewhere please post your own code and i will make the appropriate amendments.
